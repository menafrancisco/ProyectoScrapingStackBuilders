# ProyectoScrapingStackBuilders
Code challenge: You'll have to create a web crawler using scraping techniques to extract the first 30 entries from https://news.ycombinator.com/ You'll only care about the title, number of the order, the amount of comments and points for each entry.

From there, we want it to be able to perform a couple of filtering operations: Filter all previous entries with more than five words in the title ordered by amount of comments first. Filter all previous entries with less than or equal to five words in the title ordered by points.

Technologies: NodeJs AngularJs
